## Good for Now

# TODO

## Part 1 -> 30/40

### Typing 

=> Can do all 4 except maybe last one

### (Natural Deduction)

=> Nope (not yet)

### Mini-Haskell

=> should be good

### Induction Proof

=> good 

### List Programming

=> good except maybe most difficult , but takes time

### Fold Function

=> keep 10 minutes for the end to bullshit, except if it is a standard one.



## Part 2 ->

### Small Step Semantics Proof

=> Proof Steps are easy, but justifying each step using derivation tree is hard, skip and use 3 minutes at then end.

### Axiomatic Semantics Proof

=> Hard, also not a priority but keep 5~10 minutes to bullshit something
