- [x] Haskell Functions (Easy) => 7%
- [ ] Haskell Functions (Hard) => 7%
- [ ] Small-Step Proof  => 6.875 %
- [x] Big-Step Proof => 12.81% (3/4)
- [ ] Hoare logic Proof => 8 % (1/2)
- [ ] Axiomatic Semantics Proof => 9.18 %
- [ ] Promela => 3.75 %  => **Only if enough time to review else balec**
- [x] LTL => 9.375 %

## Good for Now

​		:large_blue_circle: =>  55.5 %

# TODO

## Part 1 -> 30/40

### Typing 

=> Can do all 4 except maybe last one

### (Natural Deduction)

=> Yeah solo

### Mini-Haskell

=> should be good

### Induction Proof

=> good 

### List Programming

=> good except maybe most difficult , but takes time

### Fold Function

=> keep 10 minutes for the end to bullshit, except if it is a standard one.



## Part 2 ->

### Hoare Triple Proof

=> can do it, but keep for semi-end since invariant is hard to find and proof steps are not always super clear

### LTL

=> one of the first things to do 

### Small Steps Proof

=> steps are quite easy, get at least half the points, then the derivation trees are harder, don’t spend too much time on them

### Big Steps Proof

=> When asked for derivation tree only => should be good, only don’t forget for SEQ statement, both values are updated in the final state, not only the second one.

=> Proving a predicate : mostly good, one case will always be bullshitty
