## Step 2 - Theory

##### Bandwidth of the visible light spectrum:

From 400 nm to 750 nm.

##### Is the visible light spectrum regulated?

No it is not. 

##### What is the difference between infrared and visible light ?

Infrared describes the light emitted in the wavelength between 1 mm and 700nm

##### Can infrared penetrate water ? Can visible light?

It depends on the type of infrared light. If it is far infrared light with wavelengths longer than 1,5 micro meter than it is completely absobed by water. However if it is shorter than 1.5 micrometers then it can penetrate the water surface. Visible light can also penetrate water, but less deeply. The maximum is 1000m, but often there is no visible light under 200m deep.

##### How Do Submarines communicate?

Submarines have many different ways to communicate with each other and with the surface. Over short to middle distances, submarines can communicate with thei HQ via loudspeakers and hydrophones. Also Very Low frequency radio waves can be used over few tens of meters  at shallow depths. Furthermore, extremely low frequencies(between 1-300Hz) can be used in dpeths of many hundred meters

##### How can a led be used as a receiver ?

A led can be used as a photodiode as a light detector. A photodiode is a type of photodetector capable of converting light into  current. As a photodiode a LED is sensitive to wavelength like or shorter than the length it emits.

##### What is the advantage of using a LED instead of a photodiode in consumer electronics?

A drawback of using the LED as a receiver is the fact that a LED is less sensitive than a photodetector; this property
negatively affects the achievable communication range.
